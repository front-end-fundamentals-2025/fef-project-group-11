              After cleansing and toning, gently apply a small amount of day
              cream to your face and neck. Massage in upward, circular motions,
              allowing the cream to fully absorb. Use every morning as the final
              step in your skincare routine for all-day hydration and
              protection. For added benefits, pair with our serum for a radiant
              boost. Always apply before makeup for a smooth, glowing base.
